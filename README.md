# flo_sparse_array

```Rust
use flo_sparse_array::*;

let mut sparse_array = SparseArray::empty();
sparse_array.insert(12345, "Test");
assert!(sparse_array.get(12345) == Some(&"Test"));
```

This crate provides an implementation of a simple sparse array type. This is a specialised type of hash table that
maps from a `usize` to any data type. Its main advantage over a normal Rust `HashMap` is performance when reading
or updating existing values. This performance is very consistent too.

It's also usually slightly faster when writing new values but as both this and the main hash functions have a random 
element to their performance the difference here can vary slightly based on chance.

The hash algorithm used to implement this sparse array type is the Cuckoo hash algorithm: this can access any location
with only two memory accesses after calculating the hash value.
